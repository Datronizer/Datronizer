- 👋 Hi, I’m @Datronizer
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and front end web development. Mostly games, I love games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, TS, React.JS, etc. Anything related to my work and passion, I'll learn it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet! I'm still looking for some ideas on my games and would love feedback eventually!
- 📫 How to reach me: Through email at tqc1234@gmail.com! Come say hi and tell me about yourself too!
